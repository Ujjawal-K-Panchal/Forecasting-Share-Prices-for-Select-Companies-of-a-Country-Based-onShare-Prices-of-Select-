Q. Why 67 Companies of India? Why not more or less?
A. 
To reduce dimensionality. Please find elaboration below : 

1. According to a recent survey by McKinsey, average life span of companies  was 61 years, now it's down to 18 years. (http://www.forbesindia.com/article/imd-business-school/why-you-will-probably-live-longer-than-most-big-companies/45487/1).
   According to Prof. Richard Foster Yale Univ., it was 15 years as of 18, Jan. 2017. (https://www.bbc.com/news/business-16611040)
  Hence, we take 16 years of data.
2. The NYSE and NASDAQ average about 253 trading days a year. This is from 365.25(days on average per year) * 5/7(proportion work days per week) = 260.89 - 6(weekday holidays) - 3*5/7(fixed date holidays) = 252.75 ~ 253. (Wikipedia)
    251 according to this : https://tradingsim.com/blog/trading-days-in-a-year/#Number_of_Trading_Days_in_2014
	
3. That means 4048 trading days, also, each day corresponds to a single data point. Hence we can have around 4048 data points. Square rooting that, we get 63.49 ~ 63 companies for avoiding dimensionality,  for 3 countries (India, Japan and USA) 63*3 = 189.
    Rounding it off and adding 11 companies, we make a list of 200 companies of all 3 countries as our dataset to finally form  66 prominent companies of India and 67 companies for both Japan and USA.
 3.1 Selection of these companies of India, Japan and USA includes companies listed in but is not limited to the following resources : 
                  1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_manufacturing_companies_by_revenue (largest manufacturing companies.)
   	2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_companies_of_India (Companies of India sorted by decreasing revenue).
   	3. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_companies_of_Japan (Companies of Japan sorted by decreasing revenue).
   	4. https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fortune-500-revealed-2017-list-revenue-largest-corporations/ (Largest Companies of USA by revenue.)

4. Another reason for taking 16 years of data : 
In 2001, stock prices took a sharp downturn (some say "stock market crash" or "the Internet bubble bursting") in stock markets across the United States, Canada, Asia, and Europe. 
After recovering from lows reached following the September 11 attacks, indices slid steadily starting in March 200
2, with dramatic declines in July and September 
leading to lows last reached in 1997 and 1998. The U.S. dollar declined steadily against the euro, reaching a 1-to-1 valuation not seen since the euro's introduction.

5. Also, 67-66 companies is a special majority (2/3rd of the whole, a concept used in Indian Parliament), to represent a majority of the best companies out of 100 of a country. 
   
  There are many examples where, when a country's best companies by revenue are listed, first 100 are listed only. such examples are given below :
